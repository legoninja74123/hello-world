# The Science of Jurassic Park

I've made this repository to talk about the science of Jurassic Park, and if it could ever really happen. The 1st time a saw the Jurassic
Park series I was left in awe at how they incorporated dinosaurs into a theme park. I instanty thought that I wanted to make my own
Jurassic Park on an island off of Costa Rica to make it just like the on from the movie. Then I started to look on other websites and
found out that extrsacting DNA from preserved blood from  piece of amber is almost impossible but they have said that they almost
extracted DNA from a piece of amber or ice to get mammoth DNA. 

# The Problem with Extracting DNA from Amber

If you where able to extract DNA from a mosquito in amber then there would be a lot of holes in the DNA. Scientists say DNA can last for
about 1 million years but the DNA have been in the amber for about 250 million years so heres not much chance there. a team of
researchers have seem to have found a 419 year old strand of DNA of a bacteria in the Michigan Basin. So since there's nothing I can
really do about it since i'm not really a billionaire like John Hammond but I know that another billionaire that is trying to make a
Jurassic Park with animatronics but for now that's the closest i got. As somone else said, "what's more scarier than a park full of
dinosaurs, a park full of robot dinosaurs." Now all I can da about it now is watch the movie again and hope that sombody can find it.
